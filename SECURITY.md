# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Since Nova is currently in alpha, there is no fixed versioning system.
Therefore, any code in the `main` branch is supported, and a vulnerability can be reported if it is found.

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 1.x.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| 0.x.x   | :x:                |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

**Please do not publicly disclose vulnerabilities.**

Instead, report a vulnerability privately [here](https://github.com/thaddeuskkr/nova/security/advisories/new), and I will respond as soon as possible

## What counts as a severe vulnerability?

- Database infiltration
- Bypassing password-protected short URLs
- Retrieval of _all_ or _many_ short URLs at once
